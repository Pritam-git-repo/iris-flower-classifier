# Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning Project)

This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the classical Iris dataset.  
The goal is to train and compare different ML algorithms and identify the best-performing model.

## Project Overview
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Trained multiple machine learning models
- Evaluated model accuracy
- Selected the best model

## Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
## Accuracy
Best model accuracy achieved: **91% (SVM Classifier)**

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Google Colab
